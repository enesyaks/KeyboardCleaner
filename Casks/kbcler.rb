  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    KeyboardCleaner is open-source and ad-hoc signed (not notarized by Apple).
    If macOS still blocks it on first launch, remove the quarantine flag manually:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/KeyboardCleaner.app"

    Or reinstall without quarantine:

      brew reinstall --cask --no-quarantine kbcler
  CAVEATS
